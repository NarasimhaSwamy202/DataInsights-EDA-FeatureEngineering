# Data Analysis: EDA and Feature Engineering

This repository contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering for the Zomato, Black Friday, and Flight Price datasets. The primary focus of this work is to explore and understand the datasets, preprocess the data, and engineer features that may be useful for machine learning models.

## Datasets

- **Zomato Dataset**: Dataset containing information about restaurants, including their ratings, reviews, and locations.
- **Black Friday Dataset**: Dataset capturing transactions that occurred during Black Friday sales, including customer demographics and product details.
- **Flight Price Dataset**: Dataset containing flight details, including departure and arrival locations, durations, and prices.

## Contents

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks containing the code for exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.
- **Data**: Raw and processed data files used in the analysis.
- **Reports**: Summary reports or visualizations generated during the analysis.

## Approach

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore each dataset to understand its structure, distributions, and relationships between variables.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing features to improve the predictive power of the data.
4. **Visualization**: Visualize key insights and relationships in the data using charts, graphs, and plots.
5. **Documentation**: Document findings, insights, and decisions made during the analysis process.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the repository directory:

3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks to explore the analysis and findings.
